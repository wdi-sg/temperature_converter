What did you think of this deliverable?: I think it was straight forward. But writing it out in code is slightly difficult and time consuming. Can be tricky too where you close brackets and if an item is a string or a number. Fixing bugs is really tiring. Though I think some code can be simplified, so that they can be less prone to errors.
