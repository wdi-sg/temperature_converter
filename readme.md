# Exercise: Temperature Converter

Goal: Create a program that can convert a temperature in Fahrenheit, Celsius or Kelvin to the other two units.

## Setup

* Create an `index.html` file.
* Create a `script.js` file.
* Make sure to link the script file in the `index.html`.

* Use the special `prompt` method to get input from the user:

```
var userInput = prompt('What's your name?');
console.log( userInput );
```
* After you have computed the answer, output it to the user using the `alert` method:

```
alert("I'm saying something");
```

## Specifications

### Part 1

> Your application should...

* Prompt the user for a starting `temperatureInFahr`. This should be a numerical value that represents degrees in fahrenheit.
* After receiving input it should log that same temperature in both Kelvin and Celsius.

### Part 2

> Your application should...

* Prompt the user for a starting `temperature`. This should be a numerical value that represents degrees.
* Prompt the user for a starting `temperatureUnit`. This will represent either Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin.
* The application should print out the user-submitted temperature in the two remaining units.
  * So, if the user submitted `32` and `fahrenheit`, the program should output something like the below. Feel free to customize this however you'd like.
    ```text
    32° F = 0°C = 273.15K
    ```

Using Conditionals, have your code accept either fahrenheit, celsius or kelvin, and output the other two temp types.

## Further: (if you get done with the above)

### Part 3

Use an array to store and access the user-submitted and converted temperatures. Your array will end up looking something like this...

```js
var temps = [ STARTING_TEMP, CONVERTED_TEMP_1, CONVERTED_TEMP_2 ];
```

When you `console.log` the temperatures, make sure you do that by accessing the values stored in the array.

### Part 4
If the temperature is below 0 also print out a message like "ooh it's cold out".

If the temperature is above 40 also print out a message like "ooh it's hot out".

If the temperature is above 100 print out a message like "your literally boiling".

### Part 5
Also prompt the user for their name. When you output the result, suggest the type of clothing they should wear from an array of values:

```
var clothes = [
 'nothing',
 'swimsuit',
 'shorts and shirt',
 'sweater',
 'sweater + jacket',
 'heavy jacket',
 'heavy jacket and toe warmers',
 'dont go outside if you want to live'
];
```

### Part 6
Use a for or while loop to print out the conversion results for each temperature. It's OK if you need to simplify your `console.log` statements and remove strings.

### Part 7

Using loops, create an interface that continues to ask the user for temp conversions until the user requests to stop.
